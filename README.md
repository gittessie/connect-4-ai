## Connect 4 AI
A connect 4 game that uses the minimax algorithm to look a varying number of moves into the future (depending on difficulty level selected) to determine the computer's next best move. 

## Getting Started
The game can be played [here](https://connect-4-ai.herokuapp.com/) or 
you can download the source files, 
run npm install to get necessary modules, 
then run npm start to run the app in development mode and 
open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
